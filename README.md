# Project: Space Agency Analysis ðŸš€
## Overview
The Space Agency Analysis project explores historical space missions conducted by various space agencies. It uses synthetic mission data to analyze key trends, including success rates, common challenges, technological advancements, and agency performance. The project leverages Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to generate insights.

## Key Features
Data Generation: Simulates 150 space missions with attributes like agency, mission type, launch date, duration, budget, outcome, challenges, and technology used.
Mission Success Rate: Calculates overall mission success percentage.
Challenges Analysis: Identifies the top 5 challenges space missions face.
Technology Insights: Lists the top 5 most successful technologies used.
Failure Trends: Highlights agencies with the highest number of failed missions.

## Technologies Used
Pandas for data handling
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Random & Datetime for generating synthetic mission data
